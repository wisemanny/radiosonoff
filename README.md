# radiosonoff

A very simple command line tool to turn on or off radios in Windows. Supports WiFi and Bluetooth. It is a similar action as to go to the settings app and use the switch there.

#How to use:

radiosonoff.exe <w for wifi or b for bluetooth> <on/off>

#TODO:

Support multiple radios of the same kind. Now it would do the operation for all that it finds.
